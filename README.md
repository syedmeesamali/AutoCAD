AutoCAD 2D and 3D

This repo is for various AutoCAD drawings both 2D and 3D that I work from time to time. Though some work is highly professional but I don't mind copying or distributing it bearing in mind the due respect for original work. Also it may sound strange why GitHub for non-IT / programming related works, then the answer is that there isn't any other excellent platform for sharing and showcasing the achievements as well as collaboration as is provided by "GitHub".


To start visualLISP in an IDE type "VLIDE" in the command window and it will bring up the visual LISP editor.

Some excellent resources on LISP programming:

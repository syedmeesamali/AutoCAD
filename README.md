AutoCAD 2D and 3D

This repo is for various AutoCAD drawings both 2D and 3D that I work from time to time. Though some work is highly professional but I don't mind copying or distributing it bearing in mind the due respect for original work. Also it may sound strange why GitHub for non-IT / programming related works, then the answer is that there isn't any other excellent platform for sharing and showcasing the achievements as well as collaboration as is provided by "GitHub".

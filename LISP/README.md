# LISP Routins

Explanation of various lisp routines in this folder.

Beginner level:
---------------
1_RoomArea: Calculates area of a room. Starting point for LISP (List Programming)

2_PointsDistance: Calculates distance between two points in plain AutoLISP.


Intermediate level:
---------------
3_Rad Counts: Count circles of same radius type (size)

4_CircleExport: Export details of all the selected circles to a TXT file. 

5_CircleOnVertices: Create circle on vertices of a polyline.

Advanced level:
---------------

6_OffsetCircleCenter: Take offset for each circle from an origin. 

7_Offset_OCH:   This program will take offsets for each core and provide the x,y coordinates from origin in the form of a table. Numbering of cores will also be done (not in a sequence)

11_TLC: This program selects the items in a list in sequential way so they can be modified or updated as per requirements. 

12_UpdatedOCC: This is the final more advanced version of core NUMBERING in a sequential manner (starting with x-values from lower left) and then provide a table with x,y values for each core from origin (i.e. 0,0). It can also number the cores starting from any number (i.e. any arbitrary number)

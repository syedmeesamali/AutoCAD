AutoCAD 2D and 3D

This repo is for various AutoCAD drawings both 2D and 3D that I work from time to time. Though some work is highly professional but I don't mind anyone copying or distributing keeping the due respect for original work. 

To start Visual-LISP in it's own IDE type "VLIDE" in the command window (within AutoCAD program) and it will bring up the Visual LISP editor. (LISP: List Programming)

Some excellent resources on Visual-LISP programming:
